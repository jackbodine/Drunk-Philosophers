      " What's new, Socrates, to make you leave your usual haunts in the Lyceum and spend your time here by the king archon's court? Surely you are not prosecuting anyone before the king archon as I am? The Athenians do not call this a prosecution but an indictment, Euthyphro. What is this you say? Someone must have indicted you, for you are not going to tell me that you have indicted someone else. But someone else has indicted you? I do not really know him myself, Euthyphro. He is apparently young and unknown. They call him Meletus, I believe. He belongs to the Pitthean deme, if you know anyone from that deme called Meletus, with long hair, not much of a beard, and a rather aquiline nose. I don't know him, Socrates. What charge does he bring against you? A not ignoble one I think , for it is no small thing for a young man to have knowledge of such an important subject. He says he knows how our young men are corrupted and who corrupts them. He is likely to be wise, and when he sees my ignorance corrupting his contemporaries, he proceeds to accuse me to the city as to their mother. I think he is the only one of our public men to start out the right way, for it is right to care first that the young should be as good as possible, just as a good farmer is likely to take care of the young plants first, and of the others later. So, too, Meletus first gets rid of us who corrupt the young shoots, as he says, and then afterwards he will obviously take care of the older ones and become a source of great blessings for the city, as seems likely to happen to one who started out this way. I could wish this were true, Socrates, but I fear the opposite may happen. He seems to me to start out by harming the very heart of Euthyphro the city by attempting to wrong you. Tell me, what does he say you do to corrupt the young? Strange things, to hear him tell it, for he says that I am a maker of gods, and on the ground that I create new gods while not believing in the old gods, he has indicted m\n"
